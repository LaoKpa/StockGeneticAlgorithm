# StockGeneticAlgorithm
Simple stock problem solved using genetic algorithm
In this notebook we raise a problem of one person have the posibility of invest in 3 companies for 500 timesteps (only one 
company in every timestep), and his/her actions repercute in the probable profits if he/she invest on any company in the next 
timestep and also repercute in the probability of choose any of the companies.
We solve this artificial problem by using genetic algorithms, where the choose of the company A, B or C are the genes and the 
fitness function is the total profit after the 500 timesteps.
